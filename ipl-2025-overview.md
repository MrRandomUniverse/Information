# 🏏 IPL 2025 Discord Betting Event

Welcome to the **IPL 2025 Betting Panel**, proudly hosted by **Mr. Random’s Discord Server**!  
Think you know cricket? Put your XP on the line and win big. With random refunds, live scores, custom commands, and Nitro prizes — this season’s gonna be wild.

---

## 📅 When It Happens

- **1 hour before each IPL match**, the betting panel opens in `#events`.
- It stays open until **15 minutes before** the match begins.
- You'll have that window to place your bets!

---

## 🎮 How Betting Works

- Bet using your **Discord XP**, based on your level.
- Choose the team you think will **win** the match.
- If your team **wins** ➜ you earn XP.
- If your team **loses** ➜ XP is deducted — BUT...

### 🎲 Random Refunds

Even if you lose, **Mr. Random’s magic** might bless you with a partial XP refund.  
The % refund is based on **pure randomness** AND your **server activity**.

> 👥 **The more active you are in the server, the higher your refund chance.**  
> Stay engaged, chat around, and let Mr. Random reward you for it!

| Scenario         | What Happens                                   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Your team wins   | You earn bonus XP (rewarded based on bet)     |
| Your team loses  | You lose XP, but get a random partial refund! |
| No show / no bet | Nothing happens                                |

## 🧪 Behind the Scenes – The Magic of the Backend

This entire IPL system runs like a well-oiled XP machine — thanks to our talented developers:  
**👨‍💻 Godz** and **👨‍💻 RKN**, the brains behind the operation.

Here’s exactly how everything works behind the scenes:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Bet Placement Logged

- Once a user clicks the button and places a bet successfully, the **raw betting data** is instantly logged in our **backend channels**.
- This includes:
  - Who bet
  - How much XP
  - Which team they chose

![Bet Logged](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/936244036988203028/1361822175392436344/image.png?ex=6800273c&is=67fed5bc&hm=1c3c2dbbe090843ea251a93d6d28334956b8d8b6b93deccbe12775d4887aa4be&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=475&height=290)
---

### 🔄 Step 2: Bot Processing

- Bots take this raw data and **convert it into a readable and displayable format**.
- This is mainly for internal clarity — makes it easier to double-check everything.

![Bot Processing](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1193830163075563581/1361810285538574520/image.png?ex=68001c29&is=67fecaa9&hm=96791c7d1aa0b873b64ed5fed1303948ed87ac02cc3375374b74633a51bf42da&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=657&height=359)
---

### 📢 Step 3: Public Bet Display

- The processed bet information is **posted publicly** in the `#server-notifs` channel.
- Everyone can see who bet on what and for how much — 100% transparency.

![Public Bet](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/782132328561508354/1361822485728858353/image.png?ex=68002786&is=67fed606&hm=266248d5b7f890edefb74cd6741b5188455207d42077c333f21061bd9e657f94&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=563&height=371)
---

### 🏁 Step 4: Match Ends — Bet Resolution

- After the match ends and we have a result, the **Bet Professor** steps in.
- It processes all bets, checks which team won, and **removes or rewards XP** accordingly — all in a private **backend channel**.
![Win/Loss](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/782132328561508354/1361824006998593710/New_Project_5.png?ex=680028f0&is=67fed770&hm=ae06f28ec4f0d76608955a0e4c445ab328c0aa74a713297e5cbc2cb421a4c8e5&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=516&height=195)
---

### 📢 Step 5: Final XP Outcome Display

- The final XP results (who gained, who lost, and how much) are then **automatically sent to the public `#server-notifs`** channel.
- This is where users get to see how they performed after the match.
![Final Display](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/782132328561508354/1361824907545284739/New_Project_6.png?ex=680029c7&is=67fed847&hm=6abfc40fd542ff50e0edc8a026e5fce7d4be12c7d7a3e6b2f189e23091346b4c&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=516&height=172)
---

> 💡 Every step is automated, traceable, and built with transparency in mind — all thanks to our team’s magic.
